# `ls` Clone

A lightweight clone of the Linux `ls` command, implemented to explore low-level system programming concepts such as directory traversal, file metadata, and command-line argument parsing.

## 📌 Overview

This project replicates the core behavior of the Unix `ls` command, which lists directory contents. It is intended as a learning project to better understand how standard Unix utilities work under the hood.

The clone supports basic listing functionality and selected options commonly used with `ls`.

## ✨ Features

- [x] List files and directories
- [ ] Support for hidden files (`-a`)
- [ ] Long listing format (`-l`)
- [ ] Recursive listing (`-R`)
- [ ] Sort by name (default)
- [ ] Handles files and directories as arguments
- [ ] Proper error handling for invalid paths and permissions

> Feature support may vary depending on implementation progress.
